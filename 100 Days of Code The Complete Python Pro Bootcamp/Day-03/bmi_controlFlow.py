# Exercise - Bmi calculation
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇

BMI = weight / height**2

if BMI < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are underweight.")
elif BMI > 18.5 and BMI < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you have a normal weight.")
elif BMI >= 25 and BMI < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif BMI >= 30 and BMI < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are clinically obese.")
